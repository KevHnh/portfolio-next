    "review": "This book is a must-read for anyone hesitant to start a business or pursue an idea to help others. Noah Kagan shares compelling anecdotes and lessons that highlight how our own doubts are often the biggest obstacle. While the advice to 'just do it' may sound clich√©, Kagan presents it in a refreshing and motivating way. More importantly, Kagan lays out step-by-step best practices on being able to quickly validate an idea and begin monetizing it.<br/><br/>Although, Kagan reminds us that success is not a linear path and such an endeavor is accompanied by many hardships. For instance, the common fear of asking but, more specifically, the fear of getting rejected. He challenges the fear of rejection, showing how it's essential for growth. Realizing that a 'no' isn't the end of the world but a required step in the journey that one should embrace. Kagan stresses that if your idea benefits even one person, it has the potential to impact millions, offering powerful motivation to pursue entrepreneurship."
